                    <h1> The World <br>of Elevator </h1>
                    <h4> October 12, 2022</h4>
                    <p class="p11"> 
                        My Parsons classmate stopped by for a casual cup of coffee last week. "Dude, your elevator is so f* confusing," she exclaimed as I opened the door. After a brief five-minute diatribe, we began to think about how elevator panels vary depending on the geographical location of the user. We've all felt anxious when we've seen a luxurious hotel's elevator panel. Is it touchable? Why do the abbreviations differ from one another? What is PH? Arghhh, Elevator panels are so archaic in this day and age.

            <section id="floor2">
                <div class="section2">
                    <h1> Ever got stuck in an elevator? </h1>
                    <p class="p11">Everyone, but especially people with custraphoia, dread becoming stranded in an elevator. Kinjal is still able to recall the incident with her elevator lockout. Similar to how Kinjal opted to hit "STOP" button and turn on the alarm switch, people tend to click frantically when they are stressed. "Thank goodness there was reception, because otherwise I was about to have a breakdown."Furthermore, I was mocked with laughter when I was told that "your elevator buttons don't even light up, you immediately need to write to the maintenance."

                <div class="section3">
                    <h1> Right to Left? Uh that's odd! </h1>
                    <p class="p11">Kinjal discusses how the elevator numerals read from right to left in accordance with Arabic writing after having lived in Bahrain for a while. Arabic numerals are typically substituted with western ones, although the placements are reversed to preserve regional context. For an outsider visiting the nation, it can be even more difficult to comprehend why things are the way they are. You do, however, adapt to things, is that right? User onboarding occurs for new interfaces or builds; elevators simply have a lower learning curve, she contended.

                <div class="section4">
                    <h1> Dubai and elevators </h1>
                    <p class="p11">The elevator panel is one of the simple interfaces that has been overdone. Some buildings in Dubai have strange touch-screen elevator panels that you can only use with a card to enter. I agree that safety is important, but I think having a touch screen and a language switch option is too much. Nowadays, everyone is familiar with how an elevator works, and they start by looking for the button for the floor they want to go to. There is something about the old construction site elevators that I truly appreciate. They are so unpolished and raw, yet they accurately represent the shape and operation of an elevator.

                <div class="section5">
                    <h1> Accessibility </h1>
                    <p class="p11">Have you ever thought how these elevators miss the most fundamental idea of accessibility? We're talking about touch-based interfaces. How will a blind person be able to use an elevator if each panel has a different design and lacks consistency? Although I have seen a few panels with braille and voice recognition built in, it still doesn't feel completely standard.

                <div class="section6">
                    <h1> Different abbreviations </h1>
                    <p class="p11"> Depending on the region, different floors have different abbreviations. In India, the first level is designated as "G," however there is no "G" in the United States because floor 1 is your ground floor. Similar to that, your building has the letters "PH" and "C." What do they even stand for? After explaining that PH stands for Pent House and C for Club, Kinjal signed, stating, "See, this is what I mean by the learning curve."

                <div class="section7">
                    <h1> Lobby right? </h1>
                    <p class="p11">If an elevator is crowded and you are surrounded by tall people, how will you know when you have arrived at your floor? These screens always have some glare and are impossible to view at eye level. You're reduced to simply moving around and asking if you've reached your floor, I suppose. Isn't it awkward?

                    <h1>Door Opening Backwards </h1>
                    <p class="p11">Kinjal also highlighted how different floor levels of the same alphabet can be found on different New York City buildings. Let's say that L1, L2, and L3 each have a distinct function, while  L2 takes you to the laundry ,L1 takes you to the lobby. Interestingly, despite being on opposite ends of the elevator, both open the same floor. Really intriguing, huh?
