                    <h1> The elevator dilemma</h1>
                    <p>My hypothesis was that progressive onboarding along with clear value prop at each stage will increase sign-up rate and reduce user drop offs. In order to test my hypothesis I came up with two variations in my prototype: 1. Having a guided tour with value prop mentioned at each stage of the flow 2. One variant without value prop with typical sign-up structure like competitors. This was a small a/b test with a small cohort.
